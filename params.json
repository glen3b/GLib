{"name":"Glib","tagline":"A simple general purpose C# library covering windows forms, XNA, extension methods, and more.","body":"## Welcome to Glib\r\nThis library simplifies usage of various APIs available in C#, such as XNA, Windows Forms, and conversions to common types, such as integer. For example, to parse a string as an integer, you can just run: `\"Your string\".ToInt()`. **If you find a bug, _please_ report it on the [issues page](https://github.com/glen3b/Glib/issues?state=open).**\r\n\r\n## Users of our library\r\nThis library is currently being used by:\r\n* [PGCGame](https://github.com/GreatMindsRobotics/PGCGame)\r\n\r\nIf you are using this library and want to be on this page, please contact @glen3b.\r\n\r\n## Development Builds\r\n\r\n**These builds are the latest compiled builds from the source tree. They are NOT supported in any way, shape, or form; however reports for bugs found on these builds are appreciated.**\r\n\r\n### Windows binaries\r\n\r\nThese binaries contain all of the non-XNA components, and only work on windows.\r\n\r\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/glen3b/Glib/raw/master/Binaries/Release/GlenLibrary.dll\">DLL</a>\r\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/glen3b/Glib/raw/master/Binaries/Release/GlenLibrary.xml\">Documentation</a>\r\n\r\n### XNA binaries\r\n\r\nThese binaries contain XNA components.\r\n#### Windows\r\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/glen3b/Glib/raw/master/Binaries/x86/Release/GlibXNA.dll\">DLL</a>\r\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/glen3b/Glib/raw/master/Binaries/x86/Release/GlibXNA.XML\">Documentation</a>\r\n\r\n#### Xbox 360\r\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/glen3b/Glib/raw/master/Binaries/Xbox%20360/Release/GlibXNA.dll\">DLL</a>\r\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/glen3b/Glib/raw/master/Binaries/Xbox%20360/Release/GlibXNA.XML\">Documentation</a>\r\n\r\n## Building from source\r\nTo build this library from source, you need a C# compiler at least (I recommend getting the IDE [Visual C# express 2010](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9709939)) and, to build the full library (including XNA components), [XNA game studio 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=23714) or [later](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=27599). This project includes a Visual Studio C# Express 2010 solution file. To not include XNA components, delete the XNA folder in your copy. Be sure not to include that change in a pull request!\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nDocs are available as XML documentation when you build the project, or are available on [my website](http://glen3b.pagekite.me/glibDoc/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
