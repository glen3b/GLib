{"name":"GlenLibrary","tagline":"A simple general purpose C# library covering windows forms, XNA, extension methods, and more.","body":"## Welcome to GLib\r\nThis library simplifies usage of various APIs available in the .NET framework, such as XNA, Windows Forms, and various other utilities including conversions to common types, such as integer. For example, to parse a string as an integer, you can just run: `\"Your string\".ToInt()` (extension method). **If you find a bug, _please_ report it on the [issues page](https://github.com/glen3b/Glib/issues?state=open).**\r\n\r\n## Users of our library\r\nThis library is currently being used by:\r\n* [PGCGame](https://github.com/GreatMindsRobotics/PGCGame)\r\n\r\nIf you are using this library and want to be on this page, please contact @glen3b.\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\nDownloads of GLib can be obtained from the [releases page](https://github.com/glen3b/Glib/releases).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Building from source\r\nTo build this library from source, you need a C# compiler, preferably Visual Studio 2010, and, to build the XNA library, [XNA game studio 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=23714) or [later](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=27599). This project includes a Visual Studio 2010 solution file. If you want to use Visual Studio C# express, some projects will fail to load, but you can use [these instructions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2682308/opening-non-express-vs-projects-with-visual-studio-2010-express).\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nDocs are available as XML documentation when you build the project, or (often outdated) versions are available on [my website](http://glen3b.pagekite.me/glibDoc/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
